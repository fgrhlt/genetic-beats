# 2018 Research Experiment Version
This branch of Genetic Beats is created for a research experiment where two different visualizations of the application were used in a group of 10 people to find out if one visualization is better than the other in the terms of the user trusting what the system generates more. 

This was done during a research project at Ume√• University, 2018.
